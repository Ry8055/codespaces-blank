# 1st method 
# this we can do with 3rd temporary variable . 
# x = 12 
# y = 15 
# temp = x
# x = y
# y = temp
# print("value of x",x)
# print("value of y",y)

# # 2nd method 
# # left,right = right,left
# a = 23
# b = 45
# a ,b = b, a
# print ("value of a",a)
# print ("value of b",b)



# # Ques 3 . write a program to convert float into integer .
# x = 23.3
# print(x,type(x))
# # we need to do typecasting
# x = int(x)
# print(x,type(x))



# # Ques 4 . write a program to take details from student for id card and then print it in diffrent line .

# print(name,"\n",grade,"\n",age,"\n",email,"\n",ph_no)


# Ques 5 . write a program to take user input as integer then convert it to float . 
num = int(input(print("enter a number ")))
print(type(num))
print("convert it to float")
num = float(num)
print(num,type(num))
