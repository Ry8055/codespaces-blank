Variable are placeholder which can store a value .
In simple word variable is a container that holds data inside it as a value .
Input 
a = "hello world" 
output 
hello world


- variable name should be case sensitive , 
Name = "radhe"
print(name)    #this will be wrong

2. Make sure not to use space while creating variable .
One can use _ to separate the names while creating variable .
even num = 2  # this will be wrong 
even_num = 2  # this is correct 


3 . Variable Name should not start with symbol and number
1num = 1  # this is wrong 
num1 = 1 # correct 
@h = "name"  # this also show error
